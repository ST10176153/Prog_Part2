RECIPE MANAGEMENT CONSOLE APPLICATION 

 

This console application allows users to manage recipes. Users can enter details for multiple recipes, including ingredients, quantities, and steps. The application provides functionalities to display a list of all recipes, view details of a specific recipe, calculate total calories for each recipe, and notify the user if a recipe exceeds 300 calories. Additionally, users can enter the number of calories and the food group for each ingredient. The application uses classes to structure the data and adheres to internationally acceptable coding standards with comprehensive comments explaining variable names, methods, and logic. Generic collections are used to store recipes, ingredients, and steps, and a delegate is employed to notify the user when a recipe exceeds 300 calories. Unit tests are included to ensure accurate calculation of total calories.
